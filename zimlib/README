The zimlib is the standard implementation of the ZIM specification. It
is a library which implements the read and write method for ZIM
files. The zimlib is released under the GPLv2 license terms. Use the
zimlib in your own software - like reader applications - to make them
ZIM-capable without the need having to dig too much into the ZIM file
format.
